This file is to be used as the file targeted with Issues using GitHub. 

I generated it from this website of free data: 

https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/agency-data-on-user-facilities#topic=research_navigation



The errors in this file are as follows:
- Agency 6 Center entry has a typo Arneld. It should be spelled Arnold
- Entry 7 will be asked to be removed in the GitHub Issue as there will be a request to keep only the active Centers in the document.
